# Optimizing Hyperparameters for DL Models Using EA Solving the 4 Class Spiral Classification Problem
This is a novel approaches to optimizing Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for the four-class intertwined spiral classification problem using an Evolution strategy algorithm with 1/5 success rule. Unlike the simpler two-class spiral, this four-class variant remains largely unexplored in machine learning fields.  Evolutionary algorithms can provide a dynamic and adaptive mechanism that optimizes hyperparameters of DNNs for non-linear classification tasks and this study leverages ES(1+1) with the 1/5 success rule. Without hyperparameter optimization, the baseline model achieved an average accuracy of 34.1% with an average loss of 1.32.  ES(1+1) with the 1/5 success rule found a model that delivers 93% accuracy. These findings establish evolutionary algorithms as powerful tools for enhancing DNN performance and provide valuable insights for future advancements in deep learning optimization
